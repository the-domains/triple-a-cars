  Triple A Cars is well connected in the international network of high end car
  dealers, traders and brokers. The majority of our activities take place in the
  European market of super cars, sports cars and luxury automobiles, but we also
  serve clients in other parts of the world. We have a good connection with key
  players for Bentley, Ferrari, McLaren, Rolls-Royce, Porsche, Aston Martin,
  Pagani, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Maserati and BMW. Thanks to our connections we
  can offer faster delivery, better prices or a combination of these. In the
  majority of deals we make, we connect a buyer directly to an official brand
  dealer somewhere in Europe. This provides both trust and security for the
  buyer. It is our job to find the right dealer, negotiate, ensure contracts are
  correct and delivery of the car is executed properly. We will arrange for
  logistics when necessary.    Need a car in the luxury segment? Call or e-mail
